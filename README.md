# To-Doddi-List
My first Android app, used as a way to organize notes and lists.
Author: Doddi Elgabry 
Module: MOBILE COMPUTING COM1032
App Name: To-Doddi List
Purpose: To compose, edit and keep track of lists for various purposes.
Entry: Entering the main menu of the app, the user must select which list they want to work with. The user-friendly ImageButtons make it reasonably clear to what use each list has, not neglecting the help message on display within each list when the list is empty (ie when the list is first accessed). 
Adding items: Adding items to the list is achieved by the use of the green floating action button on the bottom right. Once redirected to the editor activity, the user must press Done/Enter on the keyboard in order for the list item to be registered. Then the user can go back to the list and will be able to see the new note.
Deleting items: Items from lists are deleted by long presses on the specific list item. Pressing YES in the alert will permanently delete the item.
Editing: An item can be edited by clicking on it, making the necessary changes, and then pressing return again before going back to the list.
Navigation: The user can navigate through different lists by either using the ActionBar menu options, or going back to the main menu by pressing the red floating action button on the bottom left, and reselecting which list they want to visit from the ImageButtons.
Secret List: The secret list is a special space where a user can perform normal list activities, but with a catch. The secret list can only be accessed with a valid passcode. A passcode is set the first time the user tries to access the secret list. When a passcode is successfully set, the user will be asked to type the passcode every time they attempt to access the secret list.
